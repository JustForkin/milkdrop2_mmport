1. VisOut bug:

   only happens when the adapter of fullscreen is the same as the
   adapter of the window hiding the window sets up a race condition
   where it sometimes triggers a Quit from the parent and sometimes
   doesn't triggering the hide immediately after the new window is
   built, posting after its built and posting after the CREATE of the
   new window is executed still cause the same problem, the race
   condition is between us as a subprocess of the VisOut process and
   operations triggered by the MediaMonkey process

   the right fix is to fix it upstream in MediaMonkey; I could hack it
   with a timer but there's no proper way to do it since the state of
   the mediamonkey process isn't signalled to us
